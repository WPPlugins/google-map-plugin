== Description ==

Another fabulous component from Jonathon Byrd. Support and documentation built right into the wordpress configurations area.

This is a great little plugin that will allow you to display a google map anywhere on your website. I use this on the contact pages of clients that have a brick and mortar location and are interested in customers stopping by.

You can adjust the settings on this map to create a super small picture like thumbnail, or a very large map with all options turned on. Including the ability to give customers directions to your clients store!

Even though this is a small plugin with a single purpose, I am providing it with as much support as I am capable of doing. If you would like me to extend its functionality, all I ask is that you buy me a beer.

Please rate the components ease of use and support features, not its lack of features. Thank you!


== Installation ==

1. Upload the byrd_googlemap folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin from your wp-admin plugins menu
1. Open the Google Map Configurations and set your options. Insert your Map API key from the link provided.
1. You must click the "update options" button to activate the map.
1. Paste the single line of code below into your widget blocks or into your php files.
1. The last step to activating this template is to paste the map into whichever location you would like. The code is very simple, here it is:

`<?php global $byrdMap; $byrdMap->getGmap(); ?>`

If you have any feature requests, errors or other general inquiries you may open the Support Forum that's built right into your configurations area and make a request. I will receive an email and answer your questions as soon as possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have more then one Calendar? =

Yes and No. You may paste the calendar code into more then one location and end up with more then one calendar. But all of the calendars will read the same settings and all look the same.

= Do you provide ongoing support? =

Not only am I available through email or on my website, but I've also integrated a support forum into the configurations page so that you can ask questions directly from your wp-admin area.

= Can I buy you a beer? =

A cold Guinness please.





== Screenshots ==

1. I've screenshotted all of the pages and how they display on my website. I hope this helps.
